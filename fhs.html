<h2 class="project-step-title">Project Overview</h2>
<div class="project-step">
   <p>This project was aimed towards creating an easier to navigate, visually appealing and accessible version of the current website for the Flagler Humane Society. Our goals were to collaborate as a group of 5 people to plan out, design and deploy our website together for the final product.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="project-step-title">The Original Website</h2>
<div class="project-step">
   <p>The original site had many issues that we decided to resolve in our redesign such as text in images, inadequate contrast ratios thougtout, and content and navigation issues. The text in images as well as the contrast ratio dealt with accessibility, which we wanted to fix so that more users would be able to use the website easily. The content and navigation was also hard to manage, especially considering a lot of images and text on the pages were all different sizes and there was no cohesiveness between the colors and fonts used.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="project-step-title">The Redesign</h2>
<div class="project-step">
   <p>As a group of 5, we divided up the work evenly and worked together to create our website. Since this was a large website with 50+ pages, we assigned specific pages to team members to work on. We made sure to ask questions, give clarification, and check everyone's work for consistency as well as any possible mistakes that could have been missed during the design process. Sometimes, others catch mistakes that you don't and it was important for us to always be willing to help and give advice to one-another. As a team who was more design-oriented, we also decided to deploy our website using WordPress, which had features such as plugins and themes to help us build the website we wanted instead of writing the code from scratch. This gave us all a strong understanding of Wordpress by the end of the project. We used the theme underscores along with Bootstrap, called understrap, to create the website. Using CSS along with the Wordpress Block Editor, we were able to add our specific styles to the website that we originally planned on in our style guide and visual design guide for the project. As for myself, I was specifically assigned to the home, events and staff pages. I created the visual elements and layout of these pages as well as utilized plugins in WordPress to redesign the events page while also adding an events calendar for a different way to view and access events on the website.</p>

        <h2 class="project-step-title">Challenges</h2>
        <div class="project-step">
           <p>One of the biggest challenges I faced was working with Wordpress as a beginner. By research and help from team members that had more experience in WordPress, I was able to use it efficiently in order to create the product. Secondly, I had to be motivated in a way to make sure my ddeadlines were met while also taking my other courses. I always strived to get my work done in a timely manner and as early as possible just in case anything needed to be revised or someone else in the team needed help.</p>
         </div>
         <h2 class="project-step-title">Skills Learned and Enhanced</h2>
         <div class="project-step">
            <p>Through this project, I was able to enhance my skills in CSS and HTML as well as learn new skills such as WordPress. Using Wordpress to create a custom child theme for our website's parent theme underscores, using the WordPress Block Editor, utilizing plugins for functionality of the website such as events, tasks and blog pages were all important features of WordPress that I learned about when working on this project.</p>
